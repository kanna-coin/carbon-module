# ðŸ’¡ What is Kanna?

{% hint style="success" %}
Kanna is a community that encourages sustainable practices and regenerative agriculture through a platform that audits the cannabis production chain.
{% endhint %}

Through an advanced technological platform, Kanna plays a crucial role in auditing the production chain of this plant, verifying and ensuring that each step of the process aligns with the highest standards of sustainability and environmental responsibility.&#x20;

This audit spans from cultivation to distribution, aiming to ensure that all involved practices benefit the environment and local communities.

## Token KNN

The KNN token is a digital asset that serves as the foundation of the Kanna ecosystem. It was created with the purpose of allowing people to track regenerative cultivation practices, support sustainable initiatives, and actively participate in the community. Additionally, it serves as the primary means of interaction to access the Kanna platform: [<mark style="color:orange;background-color:green;">**https://dapp.kannacoin.io/**</mark>](https://dapp.kannacoin.io/)<mark style="color:green;">.</mark>

## ESG Protocol

Kanna's Platform performs validations and audits, certifying and encouraging cannabis producers to adopt sustainable practices in their production chain. Kanna cultivation certifications are stored on the blockchain, aiming to provide reliability and transparency to the producers' activities, promoting integrity and sustainability in the sector and boosting market regulation aspects.&#x20;

The audit processes are decentralized, as the community of holders itself can participate in the verification activities, using KNN tokens according to the regulations of each process, and at the end of the audit, producers receive a score that evaluates their project on environmental (E), social (S), and governance (G) criteria.&#x20;

Producers provide the necessary information about the regulation and production process of cannabis, while token holders act as a verifier, attesting to the quality of the information and validating the data's veracity.
