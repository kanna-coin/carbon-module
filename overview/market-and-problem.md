# ðŸ’Š Market and Problem

## Problem

The voluntary market for carbon credit certification is extremely concentrated among a few players (Verra, Gold Standard, CAR, ACR, Social Carbon).&#x20;

This centralization makes the process expensive, inefficient, slow, and cumbersome, and there is still market distrust regarding the quality and veracity of the credits due to a lack of clarity in the information related to the projects. This also hampers market consolidation and access for smaller players due to financial inviability.&#x20;

Our innovation lies in the way the certification protocol is designed, acting at the origin of credit registration, recording information first on the blockchain and only then generating the carbon credit. At this point, we differ from potential competitors who use the tokenization process for credits that have been registered through centralized processes where information can be manipulated.&#x20;

Finally, options for companies and individuals to compensate for damages and contribute to the planet's sustainability are still scarce and represent a market with a very high potential for growth, whether due to governmental requirements, as is already the case in Europe and North America, or due to demand from consumers themselves.

## Why Now?

Supporting Kanna now is a strategic opportunity, aligned with the growing demand for ESG and RWA solutions in the market, aiding in positioning and adoption by a market niche for Solana. Kanna's carbon tokenization project, a candidate for the Solana grants program, stands out for meeting Solana's search for Brazilian crypto initiatives with the application of its technology in real-impact solutions.&#x20;

This moment is particularly opportune for projects that integrate crypto innovation and sustainability, given the market's receptivity to initiatives that promote responsible environmental practices and offer concrete responses to climate change.

Furthermore, the potential partnership with Solana brings the promise of scalability and the feasibility of more affordable rates for the auditing process, leveraging the advanced infrastructure of the blockchain. Solana's ability to process transactions quickly and economically can significantly benefit the implementation of carbon tokenization by Kanna, making it more efficient and widely accessible.

Supporting Kanna now means backing an innovative project that is disrupting the current audit model, decentralizing and using blockchain to generate trust, but also contributes to sustainable development and the mitigation of climate change.

* **TAM:** By 2030 aims to neutralize 55 billion tons of carbon - source&#x20;
* **SAM:** US$50 billion Voluntary Carbon Market - source&#x20;
* **SOM:** US$72 million 30% of the Carbon Market for Hemp, estimated at about 800,000 hectares - source - (800,000 Hectares x 15 Tons/Ha x 20 dollars - 240MM x 30%)

## Benchmarking

The Kanna Carbon Tokenization Module is part of an Innovation ecosystem that benefits from an economy generated through the KNN token and the community established from the holding company that already has a notable presence in the Brazilian market for blockchain and cannabis. Additionally, it is part of an exclusive group of companies known as ReFi, or regenerative finances.

Moreover, we will be operating in a niche market where not many players are present, which is the industrial hemp market. This market has an early adopter audience that supports the cannabis cause. Hemp is considered one of the most efficient plants in CO2 removal due to its short cultivation cycle of about 4 months, the fact that it extracts 4 times more CO2 than an adult tree, and also because it fixes the CO2 in its fibers, preventing its release at the time of cutting.

Below is the differentiation of Kanna in relation to other existing solutions in the market.
