# ðŸ‘‹ Kanna's Carbon Module

> _Kanna is a company that has been in the market for about 2 years and already has an asset listed on Mercado Bitcoin, the KNN which is native to the Ethereum network and integrated into the Polygon Network. The company also has a B2B product, the ESG audit protocol for Cannabis producers._

## Overview

> ### We are Kanna, an RWA that aims to build a carbon tokenization system, through the registration of the audited production chain in a decentralized manner on the <mark style="background-color:green;">Solana Blockchain.</mark>&#x20;

We aim to develop a new module within Kanna's technology to generate carbon credits that have their origin linked to the producers' audit, consequently having the entire productive chain of the impact credit registered on the Blockchain.&#x20;

In this context, we see Solana as a technology that can help us solve some scalability and cost issues in the fees charged, enabling the processing of information recorded on the Blockchain for the creation of this new asset.
